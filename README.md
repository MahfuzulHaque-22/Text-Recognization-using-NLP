# Text-Recognization-using-NLP
To recognize words using NLP in Python, you can use the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library. 


we first download the required NLTK data for tokenization and part of speech tagging. Then, we define a sample text to process and use the word_tokenize() function to tokenize the text into individual words. We then use the pos_tag() function to tag each word with its corresponding part of speech. Finally, we print the tagged words.

Note that the part of speech tags used by NLTK are as follows:

PRP: Personal Pronoun
VBP: Verb, non-3rd person singular present
TO: to
VB: Verb, base form
JJ: Adjective
NN: Noun, singular or mass
IN: Preposition or subordinating conjunction
NNP: Proper noun, singular
